TicketBari is a modern online ticket booking platform built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**. Users can browse and book travel tickets for buses, trains, launches, and flights. The platform supports three user roles: **User**, **Vendor**, and **Admin**, with role-specific dashboards and functionalities.
